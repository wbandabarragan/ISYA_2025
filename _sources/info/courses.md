## Cosmology Course

This course explores key aspects of cosmology, including the development of cosmological models, the nature of the universe's constituents, and its thermal history. It also examines observational evidence, theoretical foundations, and research frontiers in cosmology.

### 1. The Observational Context

- Discovery and significance of the CMB

- Physical properties: temperature, isotropy, and anisotropy

- Origin during recombination and its relation to the early universe

- Angular power spectrum and its cosmological implications
  
- CMB as a probe of:
  
        • Density fluctuations in the early universe
  
        • Parameters of the standard cosmological model
  
        • Evidence for inflation and the Lambda-CDM model

### 3. The Theory of Gravitation and Inflationary Cosmology
