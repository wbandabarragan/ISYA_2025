## Course 2: Compact Objects
### Jorge A. Rueda Hernández (ICRA, Italy), 6 lectures

#### Abstract: 
In the present era of multi-messenger astrophysics, the information on most extreme astrophysical sources arrives from several carriers at different energies/frequencies: photons in the electromagnetic spectrum (from the microwaves to the high-energy gamma-rays ~TeV), massive charged particles (cosmic rays up to ultra-high energies ~millions of PeV), neutrinos (from the MeV to PeV), gravitational waves (in the millihertz region from space-based instruments and the kHz region from ground-based ones). We can also include dark matter particles via their gravitational interaction with astrophysical systems. All this information allows us to understand the most extreme astrophysical sources in the universe with unprecedented accuracy and detail. The explanation of the nature of the most energetic and powerful astrophysical sources (both quiescent and transient), such as binary X-ray sources, pulsars, novae, kilonovae, supernovae, hypernovae, quasars, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts, involve the presence of compact objects: white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes in different flavors; e.g. in a variety of masses, rotation rates and present as single systems or in binaries. The increasing quality and amount of data allow us to test our knowledge and put stringent constraints on the nature of the sources and the structure, matter content, and properties of their associated exterior spacetime. The successful and helpful extraction of the above information on compact objects from data requires that we know, with sufficient accuracy, how different physical ingredients change the properties of the objects. I focus here on compact objects' physical and astrophysical aspects, emphasizing their role in multi-messenger astrophysics. Basic knowledge of atomic physics, nuclear physics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, classical field theory, Newtonian gravity, and General Relativity are needed to accomplish this task.
