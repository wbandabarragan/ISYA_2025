# IAU's code of conduct

We aim to provide a safe, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone involved during the symposium. Harassment and offensive comments or behaviour related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religion are not considered appropriate. Please be professional and respectful to all participants. If you encounter any problematic behaviour, please do not hesitate to contact one of the organisers. We thank all the participants for their cooperation in making this symposiumÂ welcoming for all.

We will ask all participants of ISYA 2025 to carefully read and adhere to the IAU Code of Conduct, see: https://www.iau.org/static/archives/announcements/pdf/ann16007a.pdf
