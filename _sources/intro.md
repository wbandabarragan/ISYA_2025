## General Information

The International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA) is an initiative of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to reinforce and promote the development of professional astronomy in communities around the world. The ISYA places a special emphasis on students located in areas that do not have the benefit of a local research institute that teaches most of the sub-disciplines of Astronomy.

The Office for Young Astronomers of the IAU has selected Yachay Tech University, to host its 46th International School for Young Astronomers from the 6th to the 26th of July 2025. The School is co-organized by 4 universities in Ecuador, namely Yachay Tech University, Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Universidad Central del Ecuador, and Universidad del Azuay.

In the 46th International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA 2025), we expect to receive applications to attend this School from students in their early MSc/PhD studies and some senior undergraduates in the Americas, especially from Latin American and Caribbean countries. Around 30 students will be selected to participate in this school. All the selected students will participate in an intensive three-week program of lectures, practical tutorials and research projects, with up-to-date astrophysics, both on theory and observations, led by an international team of experts. They will learn about different astronomical fields, from cosmology through galaxies and the interstellar medium to stellar physics, and acquire technical expertise to analyze current observational and simulation data, mainly from access to large databases and simulation catalogues.

The official language of the School will be English. Although the ISYA is not a research conference, we encourage students to submit abstracts to present their research projects.

## Travel and Accommodation Grants
Acceptance to the school covers flights to and from Quito (including domestic transport to Urcuquí), accommodation and subsistence at the ISYA. All selected students are expected to commit 100% of their time to participate in all the planned activities held over the three week duration of the school. Notice that, apart from the academic school activities, you will also have the opportunity to experience the archaeological, artistic and scientific environments through a series of cultural visits, events and travels.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Ecuador in 2025!
